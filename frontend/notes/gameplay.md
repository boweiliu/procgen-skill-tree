- biomes. important so that density of nodes worth taking is high where it matters
- tassel clusters
- keystones that are either really good or mandatory
- the problem is when the starter area is all allocated and there's 5-10 alloc distance to any other good nodes. its sometimes not worth to go that far. keystones help
- poe system - it is almost mandatory to 1) reach all your keystones 2) get as much health and resists along the way 3) any extra points go towards DPS, as efficiently as possible
- globally good nodes, e.g. +% offense/defense which is useful for all builds
- +10.0/-10.0 system for modifier categories (up to 5). to distinguish from percents and from poe increased/multiplier/more nomenclature
- nodes which have drawbacks - like warcries which eat up action economy but provide good buffs
- nodes which reduce the downsides or increase the effectiveness of other nodes
- nodes which affect a high-tier modifier category e.g. +1 to max spectres
- situational nodes which provide bonuses only on certain quests - e.g. reduced reflect, or minion cast speed for noncaster minions
